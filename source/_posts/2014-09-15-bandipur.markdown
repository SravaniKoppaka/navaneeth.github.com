Monsoon, where the nature unleashes it's beauty, where the sound of waterfall creates a symphony.

I was off to Kerala chasing the monsoon. Kerala is pretty when it is raining. We were planning to drive down to Kerala. I packed everything last night and switched on the TV only to realize the next day is a strike in Kerala. So we decided to stay in between at Bandipur national park. During our last trip, we have observed (Jungle lodges)[] in bandipur but never got a chance to stay there. So I immediatly booked accommodation at the Jungle lodges. Got an individual cottage which they call *papiha*.

Next day, we started from bangalore at 8AM. Took the nice road towards Kanakpura. I chose Kanakpura - Malavalli - Kollegal - Chamrajnagar - Gundalpet route and avoided going to Mysore. This road is more scenic and fun to drive.

By 3PM we reached at Bandipur. Checked in to the cottage. Jungle lodges is located inside the national park and run by Karnataka government. The room quality is decent, and not so great. But the whole atmosphere there is outstanding. Here is a picture of the cottage.
